# Hong Kong Art Markets

This project will be exploring the discrepancies between art estimation and in-person auction sale amounts within Asian art markets. The research will include gaining some insights into the science of auction art estimation, which is largely kept secret by auction houses, and the characteristics that drive the value of art pieces. A more reliable idea of measuring how much an art piece will sell for in auction could be determined by examining the features shared between similarly-performing art. The project could also make determinations regarding Sotheby’s Hong Kong’s estimation ranges and whether or not they are shaded to increase sale prices.

## Dataset

### Sotheby's Hong Kong

Includes Sotheby’s Hong Kong auction results from January 2016 to July 2020. As a result, the data is focused on Chinese art, Modern and Contemporary East Asian and Southeast Asian art, including both online and in-person auction results. See `data` for a closer look at the features included.

## Research Questions

- What causes an art piece to sell outside of its estimated range?
- Are there similarities across pieces that sell above and below their estimated range,
respectively?
- How tangible are the reasons for art pieces under/overperforming?
- Is there a way to predict which art pieces will over/underperform in respect to their
estimated values?
